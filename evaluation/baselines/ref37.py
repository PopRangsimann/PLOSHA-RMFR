Baseline: HFWPF - Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Workflow Scheduling (Ref [37])
========================================================================
A Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Workflow Scheduling With Performance Fluctuated
Cloud Resources.

Paper: Ren & Yao, "A Hybrid Fault-Tolerant Workflow Scheduling With
       Performance Fluctuated Cloud Resources", IEEE Trans. Services
       Computing, 2026.

Algorithm Summary (from the paper):
  1. Preprocessing (Algorithm 1, Sec IV-A):
     - Divide workflow deadline d_i into sub-deadlines for each task
     - Time complexity: O(J²) per workflow  (Eq. described in Sec IV-A)

  2. Initial Scheduling (Algorithm 2, Sec IV-B):
     - For each ready task t_ij, select fault-tolerant strategy:
       * Resubmission (z_ij=1) if:  dl_ij - st_ij ≥ 2×(T_boot + max TT + ψ)  (Eq. 8)
       * Replication (z_ij=0) otherwise
     - Allocate to VMs using pst/pft calculations (Eq. 10-12)
     - Time complexity: O((J + N_in) × M × N_M) per workflow

  3. Online Scheduling (Algorithm 4, Sec IV-C):
     - On VM failure with resubmission: find new VM for re-execution
     - On VM failure with replication: redundant copy already running
     - Time complexity: O((J + N_in) × M × N_M)

  4. Online Adjustment (Algorithm 5, Sec IV-C):
     - Adjust sub-deadlines of unexecuted tasks based on actual finish times
     - Promote replication → resubmission when time permits
     - st_ik = max_{t_ij ∈ P(t_ik)} (aft(t_ij) + TT_jk)  (Eq. 13)
     - Time complexity: O(J × N_in)

  5. Elastic Resource Provisioning:
     - Activate new VMs when needed
     - Shut down idle VMs to reduce failure probability
     - Approximate weight for stochastic execution time:
       w(X) = E(X) + √D(X)  (Eq. 1)

Computation Cost (Table III of PLOSHA-RMFR paper):
  Prediction:   T_fluc (fluctuation estimation via stochastic model, Eq. 1)
  Scheduling:   O(J² + (J + N_in) × M × N_M) (preprocessing + initial)
  Aggregation:  None
  Recovery:     O((J + N_in) × M × N_M + J × N_in) (online scheduling + adjustment)

Communication Cost (Table IV):
  Data Collection:  N_s × |Data|
  Coordination:     |Sched| (scheduling messages)
  Recovery:         m* × |State| (scales with FULL processing window)

Key behavioral characteristics:
  - Workflow-level fault tolerance via replication + resubmission
  - Recovery scales with full processing window m*, NOT |D_i^miss|
  - Has prediction (T_fluc) but no encrypted aggregation
  - Scheduling complexity polynomial in workflow parameters (J, M, N_M)
  - Recovery overhead grows steeply under increasing failures
