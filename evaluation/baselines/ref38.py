Baseline: Fault Tolerant Data Stream Processing in SEC (Ref [38])
==================================================================
Efficient and Fault Tolerant Data Stream Processing with Uncertain
Data Rates in Serverless Edge Computing.

Paper: Xu et al., "Efficient and Fault Tolerant Data Stream Processing
       with Uncertain Data Rates in Serverless Edge Computing",
       IEEE Trans. Services Computing, 2026.

Algorithm Summary (from the paper):
  1. Optimization Framework (Algorithm 1 - Fwk, Sec IV-A):
     - Binary search for optimal number of standby instances n_m
     - Range: n_min=1, n_max=K (max standby instances = 3)
     - Fault tolerance requirement: Π Pr(f_l) ≥ δ_m  (Eq. 1)
       where Pr(f_l) = 1 - (p_l)^{n_m+1}

  2. Function Placement (Algorithm 2 - Heu, Sec IV-B):
     - Stage 1: DAG partitioning via topological sort on G'_m
     - Stage 2: Active function placement via shortest path in
       auxiliary graph G''_m
     - Stage 3: Standby instance placement via nm disjoint
       shortest paths
     - Time: O(|R|·log|V|·(|V'_m|·|V|·log(|V'_m|·|V|) +
              |V'_m|·(|E|+|V|)))  (Theorem 2)

  3. Online Prediction & Adjustment (Algorithm 3 - Adj, Sec V):
     - MT-LSTM prediction across multiple timescales
     - Groups: g_m = ⌈log₂ ρ̃_m⌉ - 1  (Eq. 6)
     - Adjustment ratio: ξ_m = ρ̂_{m,τ+1}/(ρ_{m,τ} + ρ̂_{m,τ+1})  (Eq. 7)
     - Re-locate ⌈n_m · ξ_m⌉ standby instances
     - Time: O(T·|R|·g_m·h_g² + T·|R|·log|V|·Θ)  (Theorem 4)

  4. Delay Model (Sec III-E):
     - Processing delay: d^proc = x·α_j·M_j·ρ + x'·d^o  (Eq. 2)
     - Transmission delay: max over execution paths in DAG  (Eq. 3)
     - Recovering delay: Σ y_l·κ_m·Σ d_e  (Eq. 4)
     - Total: d_m = d^pt + d^rec  (Eq. 5)

Computation Cost (Table III of PLOSHA-RMFR paper):
  Prediction:   O(T × |R| × g_m × h_g²)  (MT-LSTM)
  Scheduling:   O(|R| × log|V| × Θ)
  Aggregation:  None
  Recovery:     O(|R| × log|V| × Θ)

  where Θ = |V'_m|·|V|·log(|V'_m|·|V|) + |V'_m|·(|E|+|V|)

Communication Cost (Table IV):
  Data Collection:  N_s × |Data|
  Coordination:     |Pred| + |Place|
  Recovery:         m* × |State| (scales with FULL processing window)

Key behavioral characteristics:
  - MT-LSTM prediction + graph-based placement optimization
  - Active-standby failover mechanism for fault tolerance
  - Recovery = full service relocation + standby reconfiguration
  - Recovery scales with full processing window m*
  - Highest prediction complexity among all baselines
  - Placement overhead grows with O(log|V|) network size
